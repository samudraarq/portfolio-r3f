        My name is Samudra and I'm a frontend web and app developer from
        Indonesia. I mainly use React and Typescript, but I also use React
        Native for app development. I'm always passionate about working in
        front-end development and implementing new technology and design (that's
        why this website was created using React Three Fiber ðŸ˜‰).
